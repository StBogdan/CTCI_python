## Running the solutions

For convenience, the project has a `setup.py` that specifies a package, for local path resolving.   
This can be installed locally in the python (virtual)environment by using:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

Problems can be run by running the file, most should have a main method with some sample input, e.g. :
```bash
python p16_20.py
```

## Some highlights

### Langton's ant (Chapter 16, Problem 22)

![Result pattern](bonus/ant.png)

An interesting example of emergent patterns from simple rules. Raise the number of iterations in the code to see more of the "highway" form.  
For more information, check the [wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant).

### Tree visualising in VS Code

![Example tree](bonus/graphs.png)

This requires graphviz to be installed locally and the extension added to VS Code.   
The one used in the screenshot above can be found [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tintinweb.graphviz-interactive-preview).
